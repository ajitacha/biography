		<b>Siddhārtha Gautama </b><strong>सिद्धार्थ गौतम</strong><i> 483/400 BCE</i> Siddhattha Gotama in Pali,also called the Gautama Buddha, the Shakyamuni Buddha <em>"Buddha, Sage of the Shakyas"</em>or simply the Buddha, after the title of Buddha, was a monk  mendicant, sage, philosopher, teacher and religious leader on whose teachings Buddhism was founded. He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in the northeastern part of ancient India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.
	</p>
	

	<p>	Gautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the śramaṇa movement common in his region. He later taught throughout other regions of eastern India such as<b><ins>Magadha and Kosala</ins></b>.</p>
	
	<p>
	Gautama is the primary figure in Buddhism. He is believed by Buddhists to be an enlightened teacher who attained full Buddhahood and shared his insights to help sentient beings end rebirth and suffering. Accounts of his life, discourses and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarised after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to him were passed down by oral tradition and first committed to writing about 400 years later.

	<h2>Conception and birth</h2>

	<h3>Maya's dream of the Birth of Gautama Siddhartha.</h3>

	<p>Birthplace of Gautama Buddha in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbini"> Lumbini</a>, Nepal,a holy shrine also for many non-Buddhists.
	The Buddhist tradition regards Lumbini, in present-day Nepal to be the birthplace of the Buddha. He grew up in Kapilavastu. The exact site of ancient Kapilavastu is unknown.It may have been either Piprahwa, Uttar Pradesh, in present-day India, or Tilaurakot, in present-day Nepal.Both places belonged to the Sakya territory, and are located only 15 miles (24 km) apart.</p>

	<p>Gautama was born to a Hindu Kshatriya family, the son of Śuddhodana, "an elected chief of the Shakya clan", whose capital was Kapilavastu, and who were later annexed by the growing Kingdom of Kosala during the Buddha's lifetime. Gautama was the family name. His mother, Maya , Suddhodana's wife, was a Koliyan princess. Legend has it that, on the night Siddhartha was conceived, Queen Maya dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side, and ten months later Siddhartha was born. As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilavastu for her father's kingdom to give birth. However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a sal tree.</p>

	<p>The day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Theravada countries as Vesak. Buddha's Birthday is called Buddha Purnima in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha , meaning "he who achieves his aim". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer Asita journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king  or a great sadhu. By traditional account, this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight Brahmin scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man. Kondañña, the youngest, and later to be the first arhat other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a Buddha.</p>

	<p>While later tradition and legend characterised Śuddhodana as a hereditary monarch, the descendant of the Suryavansha (Solar dynasty) of Ikṣvāku (Pāli: Okkāka), many scholars think that Śuddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.</p>

	<p>Early texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition. The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy and seems to have been structured either as an oligarchy, or as a form of republic.The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the śramanic Jain and Buddhist sanghas, where monarchies tended toward Vedic Brahmanism.</p>

	<h2><mark>Early life and marriage</mark><h2>

	<h2>Departure of Prince Siddhartha</h2>
	<p>Siddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, Maha Pajapati.[104] By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. His father, said to be King Śuddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human suffering. While Śuddhodana has traditionally been depicted as a king, and Siddhartha as his prince, more recent scholarship suggests the Shakya were in-fact organised as a semi-republican oligarchy rather than a monarchy.</p>

	<p>When he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named Yaśodharā (Pāli: Yasodharā). According to the early Buddhist Texts of several schools, and numerous post-canonical accounts, she gave birth to a son, named Rāhula. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.</p>

	Siddhartha Gautama continued to ponder about religious questions. At the age of 29, Gautama left his palace to meet his subjects. Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Gautama is said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer Chandaka (Pali: Channa) explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a diseased man, a decaying corpse, and an ascetic that inspired him. Traditional accounts state that he saw these for the first time in his life. Shortly after, Gautama woke up at night and saw his female servants lying in unattractive poses, which shocked him. Therefore, he discovered what he would later understand more deeply during his enlightenment: suffering and the end of suffering. Some time later, he heard the news that a son had been born to him. Moved by all the things he had experienced, he decided to leave the palace behind in the middle of the night against the will of his father, to live the life of a wandering ascetic. Accompanied by Channa and riding his horse Kanthaka, Gautama left his palace for the life of a mendicant, leaving behind his son Rahula and Yaśodhara. He traveled to the river Anomiya with Chandaka and Kanthaka, and cut off his hair. Leaving his servant and horse behind, he journeyed into the woods and changed into monk's robes there, though in some other versions of the story, he received the robes from a brahma deity at Anomiya.</p>

	<p>The now mendicant Gautama began his ascetic life. He went to Rajagaha (present-day Rajgir), begging for alms in the streets. After King Bimbisara's men recognised Gautama and the king learned of his quest, Bimbisara offered Gautama a share of his kingdom. Gautama rejected the offer but promised to visit the king's kingdom of Magadha first, upon attaining enlightenment.</p>

	<p>Siddhartha Gautama left Rajagaha and practised under two teachers of yogic meditation. After mastering the teachings of the first master, Ārāḍa Kālāma (Pali: Alara Kalama), he was asked by him to succeed him. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice, and moved on to become a student of Udraka Rāmaputra (Pali: Udaka Ramaputta). With him, he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness and was again asked to succeed his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied and moved on.</p>
